# [ssbbd.dev](https://ssbbd.dev)

**ssbbd.dev** is my web portfolio!

the full (desktop) version features a dynamically generated background graphic based on the ground plan of hadrian's villa
(i worked on an archaeological excavation at hadrian's villa for a couple summers).

the minimal (mobile-optimized) version of the site delivers the same project information but employs a more graphic design.
with each user click/tap on this minimal version, the background gradient updates with a newly generated color scheme.

the site was built with react, and the contact form is powered by emailjs.

the project preview images in the full version are screen recordings; when the visitor hovers over the preview, the video plays.

all drawings are original!
