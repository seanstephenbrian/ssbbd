welcome to my portfolio website!

the full (desktop) version features a dynamically generated background graphic based on the ground plan of hadrian's villa
(i worked at an archaeological excavation at hadrian's villa for a couple summers).

the minimal (mobile-optimized) version of the site delivers the same project information but uses a more graphic design.
with each user click/tap on the minimal version, the background gradient updates with new, dynamically generated colors.

the site was built with react, and the contact form is powered by emailjs.

the project preview images in the full version are screen recordings; when the visitor hovers over the preview, the video plays.

all drawings are original!
